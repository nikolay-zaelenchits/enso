                title="THE MEANING OF ENSO"
                txt="We are often asked why we named our company ENSO. An ‘ensō’ in Zen Buddhism means a hand-drawn circle, created in a single brushstroke that symbolises strength, elegance, and the circularity of nature. Creating an ‘ensō’ circle relies on both concentration and mindfulness, clearing your mind while being fully present in the moment. When painted with black pigment, an ‘ensō’ also looks very much like a tyre. As a company developing a circular business model for tyres, we felt that ENSO gave us a clean and holistic tyre brand that symbolised that we are looking to work in harmony with nature, to bring together sustainability and better performance for electric vehicles. Ultimately it is vital that we take better care of our nature, people and planet, to find a balanced way of living. We would love you to join us on this journey and become part of our circle"
